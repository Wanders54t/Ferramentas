# Nuxt Toolbox Template 

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## Deploy to Netlify
---
Want to deploy immediately? Click this button

[![Deploy to Netlify Button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/nuxt-toolbox)

To deploy using the Netlify cli:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g # to install the Netlify CLI tool globally
netlify init # initialize a new Netlify project & deploy
```

It will use the information from the included Netlify configuration file, [`netlify.toml`](./netlify.toml), to set up the build command as `npm run generate` to create a static project and locate the build project in the `dist` directory.

The `init` process will also set up continuous deployemnt for your project so that a new build will be triggered & deployed when you push code to the repo (you can change this from your project dashboard: Site Settings/Build & deploy/Continuous Deployment).

You can also use `netlify deploy (--prod)` to manually deploy and `netlify open` to open your project dashboard.

> ðŸ’¡ we only have so many keystrokes to give, use `ntl` shorthand for `netlify` or make [an alias of your own](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/12/speed-up-productivity-with-terminal-aliases/) to save hours...of accumulated miliseconds

### Running Locally

You can use `netlify dev` from the command line to access project information like environment variables as well as 
- test functions
- test redirects
- share a live session via url with `netlify dev --live`
- [and more](https://cli.netlify.com/netlify-dev/) :)

## Forms
---

Netlify Forms are a way to wire up your native HTML into being able to seamlessly handle submissions. To get a form working, we need to add two extra things:

1. An extra attribute on the `form` tag, `netlify`

Adding this attribute to our `form` tag will let Netlify know when it loads the page, that it needs to be aware of submissions made through it.

2. A hidden input in the form, `<input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="feedback" />`

Adding this extra input allows our form to be given a name that Netlify can store submissions to. It is a hidden input so your users won't see it but it will pass along the name of our form to Netlify when we submit. In our Netlify Admins site under Forms, we will see our Active Form named `feedback` and all submissions will go there.

With both of those we're ready for folks to give us feedback!

### Adding a custom submission page

While Netlify provides a default submission page for folks, we can customize it as well! With the `action` attribute on the `form` tag we will be able to direct our users to our own page.

In [`components/feedbackForm.vue`](./components/feedbackForm.vue) you'll see the form has the attribute `action="/testpage"` this will take our user to the custom route `/testpage` which we created under [`pages/TestPage.vue`](./pages/TestPage.vue). As long as the page exists, you can direct folks to it!

### Blocking bot spam with a honeypot field

Many bots scan through webpages and try to see what pages and forms they can get access to. Instead of letting our website receive spam submissions, we can filter out unrelated submissions with a visually-hidden input field.

```
<p class="hidden">
    <label>
        Donâ€™t fill this out if youâ€™re human: <input name="bot-field" />
    </label>
</p>
```

Since screenreader users will still have this announced, it is important for us to
communicate that this is a field not meant to be filled in.

For this to work we also need to add a `netlify-honeypot` attribute to the form element.

```html
<form
  netlify
  netlify-honeypot
  action="/testpage"
  method="post"
>
```

## Redirects
---
In the [`netlify.toml`](./netlify.toml) configuration file there is an example of how to implement redirects. Redirects can be used to do many things from redirecting Single Page Apps more predictably, redirecting based on country/language to leveraging On-Demand Builders for [Distributed Persistant Rendering](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/14/distributed-persistent-rendering-a-new-jamstack-approach-for-faster-builds/). 

In the example we'll be using redirects to have a shorter endpoint to Netlify functions. By default, you call a Netlify function when requesting a path like `https://yoursite.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/functionName`. Instead, we'll redirect all calls from a path including `/api` to call on the Netlify functions. So the path will be `https://yoursite.netlify.com/api/functionName`, a lot easier to remember too. 


### Example
```toml
[[redirects]]
from = "/api/*"
to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
status = 200
force = true
```

First we create a section in the `.toml` for the redirect using `[[redirects]]`. Each redirect should have this line to start the redirect code, and the redirects will be executed in the order they appear in the `.toml` from top to bottom.

The bare minimum needed is the `from` and `to`, letting the [CDN](https://www.netlify.com/blog/edge-cdn-serverless-cloud-meaaning) know when a route is requested, the `from`, forward it on to another path, the `to`. In the example, we also added an 'Ok' status code, 200, and set the `force` to true to make sure it _always_ redirects from the `from` path.

There are many ways to use redirects. Check out the resouces below to learn more.
